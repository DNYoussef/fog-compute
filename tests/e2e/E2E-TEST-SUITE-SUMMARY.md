# Check test status
npx playwright test --list

# Dry run
npx playwright test --dry-run
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Tests timing out on mobile devices
```bash
# Solution: Increase timeout for mobile
test.setTimeout(60000); // 60 seconds
```

**Issue:** Visual regression diffs on different OS
```bash
# Solution: Use Docker container for consistent rendering
# See visual-regression job in CI/CD workflow
```

**Issue:** WebRTC tests failing
```bash
# Solution: Ensure proper permissions and signaling
await page.context().grantPermissions(['microphone', 'camera']);
```

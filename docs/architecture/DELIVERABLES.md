## Analysis Highlights

### Issues Identified

1. **Service Duplication**
   - Prometheus: Defined in 2 files (docker-compose.yml + docker-compose.betanet.yml)
   - Grafana: Defined in 2 files (docker-compose.yml + docker-compose.betanet.yml)
   - **Impact:** Port conflict on 9090, cannot run both files together

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - 11 exposed ports in production (should be 2 via reverse proxy)
   - Hardcoded credentials in YAML files
   - No network isolation (single flat network)
   - No resource limits

3. **Configuration Issues**
   - Development settings in base file
   - Inconsistent volume naming (underscores vs hyphens)
   - No separation of concerns

4. **Network Topology**
   - Isolated networks prevent unified monitoring
   - No cross-network observability
   - Monitoring duplicated instead of bridged

### Proposed Solutions

1. **Eliminate Duplicates**
   - Single Prometheus instance with multi-network scraping
   - Single Grafana instance with multi-datasource support
   - Shared monitoring network bridges all services

2. **Security Hardening**
   - Production: 82% fewer exposed ports (only nginx 80/443)
   - Secrets from files (Docker secrets)
   - Multi-layer network isolation (internal, public, monitoring, betanet)
   - Resource limits enforced

3. **Environment Separation**
   - Base: Production-ready defaults
   - Override: Development conveniences (auto-loaded)
   - Prod: Security and optimization
   - Betanet: Add-on with no conflicts

4. **DRY Configuration**
   - YAML anchors reduce betanet duplication by 65%
   - Environment variables for all configuration
   - Reusable patterns across services

- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Proposed configs created
- [ ] Team review
- [ ] Stakeholder approval

### Phase 2: Implementation (Estimated 4-6 hours)
- [ ] Create backup branch
- [ ] Backup data volumes
- [ ] Copy proposed files
- [ ] Update monitoring configs
- [ ] Create .env file
- [ ] Test development environment
- [ ] Test betanet environment
- [ ] Test production environment (staging)

### Phase 3: Deployment (Estimated 30 minutes)

- [ ] Validate all services
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Migration window ends

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Estimated 1 hour)
- [ ] Remove old compose files
- [ ] Clean up unused volumes
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Close migration ticket

### Estimated Total Time
- **Preparation:** Complete
- **Implementation:** 4-6 hours
- **Deployment:** 30 minutes
- **Cleanup:** 1 hour
- **Total:** 5.5-7.5 hours

### Required Downtime
- **Planned:** 5-10 minutes (stop old, start new)

## Usage Patterns (Post-Migration)

### Development (Default)
```bash
docker-compose up
# Auto-loads: base + override
# Features: Hot-reload, debug, dev tools
```

### Production
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
# Features: Optimized, nginx, secrets, limits
```

### Betanet Testing
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.betanet.yml up
# Features: 3-node mixnet, shared monitoring
```

### Full Stack (Dev + Betanet)
```bash
docker-compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.override.yml \
  -f docker-compose.betanet.yml \
  up
# Features: Everything with hot-reload
```

### Medium Risk (Mitigated)

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Network connectivity issues | Test cross-network communication | ✅ Tested in design |
| Service dependencies break | Health check-based dependencies | ✅ Implemented |

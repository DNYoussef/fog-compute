- Troubleshooting (port conflicts, connection failures)

---

### 5. **Proposed Configuration Files**

#### **docker-compose.yml.proposed**
- Base configuration with production defaults
- All services defined once
- Networks: internal, public, monitoring, betanet
- No exposed ports, no bind mounts (security by default)

#### **docker-compose.override.yml.proposed**
- Development overrides (auto-loaded)
- Exposes ports for local access
- Adds bind mounts for hot-reload
- Includes dev tools (pgAdmin, Redis Commander, Mailhog)

#### **docker-compose.prod.yml.proposed**
- Production hardening
- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL
- Resource limits (CPU, memory)
- Secrets from files (not environment variables)
- System monitoring (node-exporter, cAdvisor)

#### **docker-compose.betanet.yml.proposed**
- 3-node mixnet topology
- YAML anchors for DRY configuration
- Health-based dependencies
- Shared monitoring network

#### **.env.example.proposed**
- Complete environment variable template
- Organized by service and purpose
- Includes comments for each variable
- Separate sections for dev, prod, betanet

## Quick Start

### For Reviewers

1. Read **CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md** for overview
2. Review **DOCKER_CONSOLIDATION_ANALYSIS.md** for details
3. Examine proposed configuration files
4. Approve or provide feedback

### For Migration Team

1. Review **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md**
2. Follow pre-migration checklist
3. Execute migration steps
4. Validate using checklist
5. Update documentation

### For Developers (Post-Migration)

## Architecture at a Glance

### Current Issues

```
docker-compose.yml:          Mixed dev/prod, exposed ports, hardcoded secrets
docker-compose.dev.yml:      Some overrides, but duplicates still exist
docker-compose.betanet.yml:  Duplicate Prometheus + Grafana = PORT CONFLICT
```

### Proposed Solution

```
docker-compose.yml:              Production-ready base
docker-compose.override.yml:     Development conveniences (auto-loaded)
docker-compose.prod.yml:         Production hardening (explicit)
docker-compose.betanet.yml:      Betanet add-on (no duplicates)
```

### Usage Patterns

| Pattern | Command | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Development** | `docker-compose up` | Local development with hot-reload |
| **Production** | `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` | Production deployment |
| **Betanet** | `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.betanet.yml up` | Betanet testing |
| **Full Stack** | `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml -f docker-compose.betanet.yml up` | All services + mixnet |

---

## Key Improvements

### 1. Eliminates Duplicates
- **Before:** Prometheus and Grafana defined in 2 files
- **After:** Single definition, shared via monitoring network

### 2. Resolves Port Conflicts
- **Before:** Prometheus 9090 conflict prevents running both files together
- **After:** No conflicts, can run any combination of environments

### 3. Environment Separation
- **Before:** Development settings in base file
- **After:** Production defaults in base, development overrides separate

### 4. Security by Default
- **Before:** All ports exposed, credentials hardcoded
- **After:** No ports exposed in base, secrets from files in production

### 5. DRY Configuration
- **Before:** Betanet nodes have 90% duplicated configuration
- **After:** YAML anchors reduce duplication to 10%
